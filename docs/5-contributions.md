# Contributions ü§ù

We encourage contributions of all types! Whether it's reporting issues, suggesting new features, or submitting pull requests, you're welcome to help improve the plugin.

- Feel free to submit [pull requests](https://github.com/CodandoTV/popcorn-guineapig/pulls).

## Some tips

- We primarily use IntelliJ IDEA for developing new features and fixing bugs. While it's possible to use Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA is the more convenient option, especially since we are working on a Gradle plugin;

- When developing a **new architecture rule**, make sure to **write unit tests** for it. Additionally, you can create a sample in the sample directory to simulate the architecture violation;

- If you have any questions about contributions, feel free to reach out to someone from CodandoTV. You can contact [Gabriel Moro](mailto:gabrielbronzattimoro.es@gmail.com) or [Rodrigo Vianna](mailto:rodrigo.vianna.oliveira@gmail.com).
