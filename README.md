# Welcome! üëã

Welcome to the **Popcorn Gradle Plugin**!

This project is currently under development üõ†Ô∏è

The goal of this plugin is to help enforce architectural rules in your project. Once you apply the plugin and specify your architecture guidelines in a `config/popcorn.json` file (located at the root of your project), the plugin will automatically verify whether your architecture adheres to these rules.
